      My goal in this project was to learn <a href="https://www.cursor.com/" className="link">Cursor</a>, and develop my ability to write long-horizon prompts. Within the next year I think all developers will be orchestrating <a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-agents" className="link">Agents</a> to navigate long-horizon tasks - that is, a task that requires a series of actions and decisions - as part of our day to day work.
    </p>

    <p>
      For instance, "create a feature that does X & Y", or "investigate products A, B, C, consider users X & Y, and then do S."
    </p>

    <p>
      When I first started to utilise long-horizon prompting, I realised it wasn't an entirely familiar way of thinking about a coding challenge. Usually I would break down a task into a series of prioritised steps, tackling each one at a time - gradually building a more complete understanding of the overall picture. But long-horizon prompting requires a comprehensive, holistic vision upfront.
    </p>

    <p>
      And so the idea for a <i>one-prompt-site</i> was born. Not a particularly practical idea, but a fun context for learning.
    </p>

    <p>
      After initializing a new React app, I started with a simple sketch. Staying true to the theme, I had ChatGPT mock up the design so that it would be more readable moving forwards. This would be used as part of the <i>one-prompt-site</i> prompt.
    </p>

    <img src={designMockup} alt="Final design mockup" className="blog-image blog-image--shadowed blog-image--outlined" />
    
    <p>
      Next, I wrote down anything I could think of - trying to capture everything required for the prompt.
    </p>

    <p>
      The result was lenghty, but rather than using it immediately, I first ran it past ChatGPT and asked if anything was missing or ambiguous (as suggested by <a href="https://www.prompthub.us/blog/using-llms-to-optimize-your-prompts?utm_source=chatgpt.com " className="link">Prompt Hub</a>). This led to iteration before even reaching the IDE - a great practice when working in a context that has the Agent working for an extended period of time, as this inherently has a slow feedback loop.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Finally, I asked the Agent to build my site. Unfortunately, even after a few alterations, I wasn't happy with what was produced.
    </p>
    
    <img src={badWebsiteAttempt} alt="Bad website attempt" className="blog-image blog-image--shadowed blog-image--outlined" />
    
    <p>
      It was at this stage I turned to <a href="https://promptengineering.org/system-prompts-in-large-language-models/" className="link">system prompts</a>, known as <a href="https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules" className="link">Rules</a> in Cursor.
    </p>

    <p>
      These <a href="https://www.promptly.fyi/library" className="link">things</a> are <i>powerful</i>. They are used to customise your Agent - building knowledge, context, and even behaviour. They frame the Agent's reasoning so that it can better stick to the brief and realise your vision.
    </p>

    <p>
      The most important change I made was a rule for the Agent to require confirmation at logical stages, and to ask questions when missing key information. This led to a much more successful outcome - both in terms of design and code quality. I was able to work with the Agent to build the website <i>together</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
      A highlight was being asked for more clarity around link styling. I hadn't given much information for this element previously, but <i>it</i> prompted <i>me</i> to have a think and provide clearer instruction. I was amazed the Agent spotted this gap and knew to ask for my input in plugging it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Overall this was a fun experience and the result was much stronger than I hoped for. The key lesson I'll be taking away is the value in thoughtful prompting, as well as the power in treating the Agent not as an algorithm, but as a partner to work with.
