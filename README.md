# One Prompt Site

A React-based personal portfolio exploring AI-augmented development workflows through long-horizon prompting and human-AI collaboration.

## Project Intent

This site explores working with agents to complete complex, multi-step development tasks through a single comprehensive prompt. The blog component documents the learning journey, highlighting:

- The shift from step-by-step development to holistic, long-horizon prompting
- The power of system prompts (Cursor Rules) in shaping AI agent behavior
- Treating AI agents as collaborative partners rather than tools
- The importance of confirmation checkpoints and clarification requests
