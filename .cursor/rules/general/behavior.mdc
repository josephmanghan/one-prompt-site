# Interaction Behavior and Validation

This document outlines how the tool should interact with users, validate its work, and handle uncertainty or ambiguity.

## Iterative Workflow Pattern

Follow this iterative approach for all work:

1. **Small, Focused Steps**:
   - Break down work into small, manageable chunks
   - Complete one logical step at a time
   - Never attempt to complete the entire task in one iteration

2. **Step Completion Communication**:
   - Summarize what was accomplished in the current step
   - Include key decisions made and their rationale
   - Keep summaries concise but informative (3-5 bullet points)

3. **Next Step Explanation**:
   - Clearly describe the next step according to the instructions
   - Explain why this step is necessary
   - Outline what will be accomplished in this step

4. **User Confirmation**:
   - Explicitly ask for confirmation before proceeding
   - Use a consistent format: "Shall I proceed with [next step]?"
   - Wait for user approval before executing the next step

5. **Step Size Guideline**:
   - Analysis steps: Focus on one aspect (e.g., one scenario, one component)
   - Generation steps: One file or logical component at a time
   - Testing steps: One test case implementation at a time

Example workflow pattern:
```
[Summary of completed work]
- Analyzed the "View Entity Details" scenario
- Identified 3 key UI components needed
- Determined test data requirements

[Next step]
Next, I'll implement the EntityDetailsPage object with all required locators and methods.
This will serve as the foundation for interacting with the entity details view in our tests.

Shall I proceed with creating the EntityDetailsPage object?
```

## Interaction Principles

1. **Clear and Concise**: Provide direct, clear responses focused on the task at hand.
2. **Proactive Problem-Solving**: Identify and address potential issues before they arise.
3. **Step-by-Step Transparency**: Explain the process and reasoning clearly.
4. **Educational**: Explain decisions in a way that helps users understand the rationale.
