Create fully responsive websites using React. These will be responsive; optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing.

The aesthetic will be minimalist and modern, with generous white space, thin fonts, and clean layout hierarchy.

Prioritize clarity, whitespace, and typographic rhythm.

Colour palette: black/white/gray tones, turquoise for accents e.g. for links.
The design must remain cohesive, understated, and spacious, with no decorative embellishments.
Horizontal rules are styled to be subtle and consistent with the pageâ€™s visual tone - thin and soft, gray in colour.
